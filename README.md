# The exercises of the master course "Machine Learning for System and Control" at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)

These exercises cover 

  1. Basics of train, validation and test set.
  2. Modelling dynamical systems with neural networks
  3. Modelling dynamical systems with deep neural networks
  4. Gaussain processes and byasian optimization
  5. Tabular and non-Tabular Reinforcement Learning
  6. Deep Reinforcement Learning
  7. Model interalized RL

For the course a basic knoweldege of programming (e.g. python or MATLAB) and the basics calculus and linear algebra is assumed.

These are the exercises for the course Machine Learning for System and Control 
Mostly written by Gerben I. Beintema (2021-2024) (gerben.beintema@gmail.com and

Here all the notebooks starting with sol_ are the solution notebooks. 
The solution notebooks can be converted automaticly into the notebooks 
without the solution by running "Solution stripper.py". 
This file also generates "Install-python-anaconda.pdf" which requires "mdpdf"
to be installed using pip (i.e. "pip install mdpdf"). 

The solution stripper will remove all lines which have been appended #a) 
and replace them with #a) Fill this. Futhermore if the line ends with #a=) 
than everything after the equal sign will be removed. I recommend viewing the 
files to better understand how this works exactly.
