Here all the notebooks starting with sol_ are the solution notebooks. 
The solution notebooks can be converted automaticly into the notebooks 
without the solution by running "Solution stripper.py". 
This file also generates "Install-python-anaconda.pdf" which requires "mdpdf"
to be installed using pip (i.e. "pip install mdpdf"). 


The solution stripper will remove all lines which have been appended #a) 
and replace them with #a) Fill this. Futhermore if the line ends with #a=) 
than everything after the equal sign will be removed. I recommend viewing the 
files to better understand how this works exactly.
